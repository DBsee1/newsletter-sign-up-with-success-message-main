What I learned
I learned how to create a responsive newsletter sign-up form with form validation and success message handling. This project improved my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also gained experience in using React and styled-components for building the UI components.

Continued development
I plan to continue developing my skills in front-end development by taking on more complex projects and diving deeper into advanced topics such as state management, API integration, and animations.

Useful resources
MDN Web Docs: MDN provides comprehensive documentation on web technologies and was a valuable resource for understanding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts.
